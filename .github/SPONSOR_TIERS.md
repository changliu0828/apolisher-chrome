Hi! 👋 I'm Chang, creator of apolisher-chrome.

I built this extension to help everyone write better, faster. As a developer who writes a lot of emails, docs, and code comments, I wanted a privacy-first tool that works everywhere.

Your sponsorship helps me:
- Keep the extension free and open-source

Every dollar helps! Even a coffee means the world to me. ☕

Thank you for considering sponsoring this project! 🙏
